SDLC (software deployment life cycle)

Session 3 (CICD)

VS code Test
1) code quality / security , (Sonarqube checks the quality of code)
2) build (Maven is build tool) Convers 10 GB code to 10 MB code storted in cat in Githbub 
Jfrogs tools which stores the files like a repo (smallfiles + articacts / binararies ) (e.g size of file at Jfrog is 10 mb) 
Artifacts are nothing but binaries like jar files, library files or executables like .exe which needs to be stored in a central location 
so that they can be deployed to a server to run.

Maven is build tool which builds(compiles) the source code into binaries (jar files etc,) and JFrog is a repository which stores those binaries in a particular folder structure, like how Git stores the source code of the application

This 10MB file converts into an image
3) deploy
code > Jar file > image > container > POD
java application >> container >> POD

Difference between statefulset and depplyment

Deployment: Deployment is a resource that manages a set of identical pods. 
	    It allows you to manage the state of your application so that the correct number of replicas are running at all times.
1. Scalability: Deployment can scale up and down the number of replicas based on demand, 
		ensuring that your application can handle increasing traffic loads.
2. Rolling Updates: Deployment can update the pods in a rolling fashion, allowing you to perform updates without any downtime.
3. Automatic Rollbacks: Deployments can automatically roll back to the previous version if an update fails, 
                        ensuring that your application remains available.


StatefulSet: StatefulSet is a resource that manages a set of identical stateful pods. 
      It’s useful for managing stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage.
1. Ordered pod creation: StatefulSet ensures that each pod is created in a specific order, 
			allowing applications to rely on the order of pod creation for initialization tasks.
2. Stable network identities: StatefulSet provides stable network identities for each pod, 
			      making it easy to communicate with specific pods in the set.
3. Persistent storage: StatefulSet can manage the creation and deletion of persistent volume claims (PVCs), 
			ensuring that each pod has a unique persistent storage.

Deployment is useful for managing stateless applications, 
while StatefulSet is useful for managing stateful applications that require stable network identities and persistent storage


Securing Docker image
    1. Choosing the right base image from a trusted source and keeping it small
    2. Using multi-stage builds
    3. Rebuilding images
    4. Check your image for vulnerabilities
     
How to Reduce Docker Image Size?
    1. Use Minimal Base Images
    2. Use Docker Multistage Builds
    3. Minimize the Number of Layers
    4. Keep Application Data Elsewhere
    5. Use Dockerignore
    6. Understanding caching

FROM alpine:latest
ENTRYPOINT ["ls"]
CMD ["-alh"]

CMD can be overwritten


HOW ALB CONTROLLER WORKS?

The controller runs on the worker nodes, so it needs access to the AWS ALB/NLB resources via IAM permissions. 
The IAM permissions can either be setup via IAM roles for ServiceAccount or can be attached directly to the worker node IAM roles.
1. Create IAM OIDC provider
2. Download IAM policy for the AWS Load Balancer Controller
3. Create an IAM policy called AWSLoadBalancerControllerIAMPolicy
4. Create a IAM role and ServiceAccount for the Load Balancer controller, use the ARN from the step above
5. helm repo add eks https://aws.github.io/eks-charts
6. helm install aws-load-balancer-controller eks/aws-load-balancer-controller --set clusterName=xyz -n ingress

internet > Loadbalancer > ingress > ingress controller checks > service > Loadbalance traffic across avilable POD of that specific service

Prometheus scrapes metrics from kubernetes componnets and applications.
Gafana provides Visuallization and Dashboards capabilities.
Node level metrics: collects and monitor node level metrics(CPU,memory,disk,network)Using tools like Node Exporter or Cadviser.
These tools export metrics to Prometheus, which stores and manages the data.
Fluentd- Deploy fluentd as a Daemonset on each node in the K8s cluster. 
so fluentd collect logs from containers running on each node and send them to Elasticsarch

   - Implement Elastic Load Balancing to distribute incoming traffic across multiple instances and availability zones.
   - Deploy applications across multiple Availability Zones (AZs) for fault tolerance using AWS Multi-AZ deployments.
   - Utilize AWS Route 53 for DNS failover and health checks to route traffic to healthy instances.
   - Implement distributed caching using services like Amazon ElastiCache to improve performance and resilience.

7. Your development team is adopting a microservices architecture for a new project 
on AWS. How would you design a scalable and resilient infrastructure to support 
microservices deployment, communication, and monitoring?

Answer:

 **Designing Microservices Architecture on AWS:**
   - Utilize container orchestration services like Amazon ECS or Amazon EKS for managing microservices deployment and scaling.
   - Implement service discovery and communication using AWS App Mesh or Amazon Route 53 service discovery.
   - Utilize centralized logging and monitoring using AWS CloudWatch and AWS X-Ray for tracing requests across microservices.
   - Implement circuit breakers and retry mechanisms to handle failures gracefully between microservices.
   - Design a resilient data layer using microservices patterns like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) and event sourcing.


8. Your company operates globally and needs to ensure low-latency access to its web
